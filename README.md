# Personal Infrastructure (work in progress)

This repository contains the code for my personal infrastructure:
- An S3 bucket for backing up my external drive via duplicity
- A mailserver using postfix and dovecot, including backups
- S3 bucket and cloudfront for my [personal website](https://saschaeglau.com/)
