# Service Control Policies

This module uses an [allow list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/SCP_strategies.html#orgs_policies_allowlist)
to control access to services. In order for this to work, you need to remove the default FullAWSAccess policy from your organization root.
